## Test Strategy

### Test Types

1. **Functional Testing**
   - **Description**: Functional testing ensures that the API endpoints work as expected and meet the specified requirements. It covers scenarios such as user registration, login, logout, and admin actions like updating and deleting users.
   - **Contribution**: Validates the core functionality of the API and ensures that each endpoint performs its intended function correctly.

2. **Security Testing**
   - **Description**: Security testing identifies vulnerabilities and ensures that the API is protected against unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats.
   - **Contribution**: Ensures the API can handle various security threats, protecting sensitive user data and maintaining system integrity.

3. **Performance Testing**
   - **Description**: Performance testing evaluates the API's responsiveness, stability, and scalability under various conditions. It includes load testing, stress testing, and endurance testing.
   - **Contribution**: Ensures the API can handle a high number of requests, maintain performance standards under load, and recover gracefully from failures.

4. **Integration Testing**
   - **Description**: Integration testing checks the interaction between different components of the system to ensure they work together seamlessly.
   - **Contribution**: Ensures that the API integrates well with other services and systems, providing a smooth user experience.

### Justification for Excluding Certain Types of Testing

1. **Usability Testing**
   - **Description**: Usability testing focuses on the user interface and user experience, which is outside the scope of API testing. The API does not have a direct user interface.
   - **Contribution**: Irrelevant to API testing as it deals with backend services.

2. **Compliance Testing**
   - **Description**: Compliance testing ensures adherence to industry standards and regulations, which may not be applicable or necessary for this public API.
   - **Contribution**: Not essential for this specific API testing strategy.

3. **Localization Testing**
   - **Description**: Localization testing ensures the application works well in different regions and languages. The API does not have regional or language-specific functionalities.
   - **Contribution**: Not applicable as the API is not designed for localization.
